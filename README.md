# Project: Landing Page

For this project, I have been asked to create a website landing page based on a
provided image. Detailed instructions can be found on The Odin Project under
[Project: Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

> **NOTE**
>
> This website is designed to be viewed from a regular computer screen. It will
> not adjust for different screen sizes, zoom levels, or mobile devices. It
> looks like garbage on my cellphone. That is OK. This is an early project and I
> have not learned how to make responsive webpages yet.
